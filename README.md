## Developer Notes

### Build the `.exe` Yourself

Create `dist/`, `build/`, and `pyinstaller.spec`, then run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon="icon.ico" ^
  --add-binary "path\to\Spire.Presentation.Base.dll;spire\presentation\lib" ^
  --add-binary "path\to\libSkiaSharp.dll;spire\presentation\lib" ^
  concatPowerPoints.py
```
Make sure you're in the right virtual environment and have all dependencies installed.
